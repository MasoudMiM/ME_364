This dataset comes from research by TR/Selcuk University Mechanical Engineering department. 
The aim of the study is to determine how much of the adjustment parameters in 3d printers affect the print quality, accuracy and strength. Where there are nine setting parameters and three measured output parameters.

Setting Parameters:
•	Layer Height (mm)
•	Wall Thickness (mm)
•	Infill Density (%)
•	Infill Pattern ()
•	Nozzle Temperature (Cº)
•	Bed Temperature (Cº)
•	Print Speed (mm/s)
•	Material ()
•	Fan Speed (%)

Output Parameters: (Measured)
•	Roughness (µm)
•	Tension (ultimate) Strenght (MPa)
•	Elongation (%) 
This work is based on the Ultimaker S5 3-D printer settings and filaments. Material and strength tests were carried out on a Sincotec GMBH tester capable of pulling 20 kN.
