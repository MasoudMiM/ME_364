**The U.S. Wind Turbine Database**

In 2016, USGS, LBNL, and the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA, the predecessor of ACP) began collaborating on development of the USWTDB. Their goal was to create a joint product that would be more comprehensive and accurate than their individual wind turbine data sets. Federal agencies began using these combined data in April 2017, and in April 2018 the data were released to the public via this portal.

These data are used by government agencies, scientists, private companies, and citizens for a variety of analyses. Examples include operational impact assessments of turbines on air defense radar, weather and general aviation, analyses related to the role of wind energy in the U.S. electric grid, interactions between wind energy facilities and wildlife, and investments in wind energy infrastructure.

The data were created by combining publicly available data sets from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), USGS WindFarm data from a prior effort, online sources, and data privately held by ACP and LBNL. The locations of all turbines were visually verified to within 10 meters using high-resolution imagery. Technical specifications of the turbines are based on the make and model and other information collected.
